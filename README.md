# Spring Boot on Kubernetes

The purpose of this example is to demonstrate the following:

- How you can use the kubernetes-spring-stater.
- How dekorate detects that this is a web app and automatically configures a service.
- How you can trigger a docker build after the compilation.

This example has been used in Codemotion Spanish edition 2021 and is based on the [Dekorate Spring Boot example](https://github.com/dekorateio/dekorate/blob/cb7e0c2e052a15a4e8909df5f5e615da98d8e1f7/examples/spring-boot-on-kubernetes-example/readme.md#L1-L59)
